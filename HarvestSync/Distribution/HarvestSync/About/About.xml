	<description>Version 1.0.0

A mod that lets you set certain zones to only be harvested when all plants in the zone has fully grown.
	
A version that works with hydroponics will be coming soon!
	
Also lets you disable harvesting in zones completely.
	
You can set zones to be harvested in 'sync' or to be never harvested by clicking the "Harvest: &lt;Setting&gt;" button. The checkmark on the button indicates if the zone can currently be harvested.
	
After all plants in a zone fully grow, the zone stays fully harvestable until all mature plants have been harvested. This allows colonists to continue harvesting zones as they plant new crops.\

If something makes a plant instantaneously come to maturity or die, there may be some delay in the zone being harvestable or not because of the relatively low frequency of checks for harvestability.
	
Please report any problems you find with this mod.
