	<description>Version 1.0.1

A mod that lets you set certain zones to only be harvested when all plants in the zone has fully grown.
	
A version that works with hydroponics will be coming soon!
	
Also lets you disable harvesting in zones completely.
	
You can set zones to be harvested in 'sync' or to be never harvested by clicking the "Harvest: &lt;Setting&gt;" button. The checkmark on the button indicates if the zone can currently be harvested.

If you want to ignore a number of ungrown plants, you can set a zone to ignore a certain number of plants by clicking on the appropriate button (not shown on preview image) when inspecting your zone and manipulating the slider.

After all plants in a zone fully grow, the zone stays fully harvestable until all mature plants have been harvested. This allows colonists to continue harvesting zones as they plant new crops.

The number of plants ignored is set to a certain percentage of the number of cells in a zone. Changing a zone will also change the number of plants ignored. This is so that you don't have to change the ignores every time you change a zone.

If something makes a plant instantaneously come to maturity or die, there may be some delay in the zone being harvestable or not because of the relatively low frequency of checks for harvestability.
	
Please report any problems you find with this mod.
